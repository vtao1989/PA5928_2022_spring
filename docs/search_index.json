Use of RStudio to carry out R file and related dataset management functions. Tools and techniques for data analysis and statistical programming in quantitative research or related applied areas. Topics include data selection, data manipulation, and data visualization (including charts, plots, histograms, maps, and other graphs). 1.2 Course prerequisites Introductory statistics; ability to create bar graphs, line graphs, and scatter plots in MS Excel; and familiarity with principles of data visualization. 1.3 Logistics Lecture section: 2:30 - 3:45 pm Tuesday and Thursday Instructor: Tao Tao, taotao@umn.edu Location: HHH 85 Lab Office hour: TBD Canvas: All course notes will be posted in this course website, but links will be updated on Canvas simultaneously. Canvas will also be used to submit your assignments, final project, and grades. Make sure you have enabled the notification of this course on Canvas. 1.4 Course learning outcomes At the end of this course, students will be able to: Use RStudio to carry out R file and related database management Use R to work with different types of databases and conduct basic data management Use R to visualize data with different types of plots Use R to carry out exploratory data analysis 1.5 Readings The online note is the main study material in this course. The course has several supplementary reading materials, which are available on Canvas. 1. Wickham, H. (2016). ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis. Springer. 2. Wickham, H., &amp; Grolemund, G. (2016). R for data science: import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model data. OReilly Media, Inc. 1.6 Weekly assignment and final project Weekly assignment includes in-class exercise and after-class assignment. Students are required to submit both of them (R codes) with necessary notes. Weekly assignment is always due on next Monday 11:59 pm. Missing deadline results in a penalty in grades (10% of the total grades for each 24 hours, less than 24 hours will be counted as 24 hours). Check your files before submission. Wrong submission results in a penalty in grades (20% of the total grades). Students will use the knowledge from this course to complete a final project (data analysis for a interested research question and make a poster to show off their work). You can find the description of the final project in the chapter of final project). Grading policy Weekly assignment: 70% Final project: 30% Weekly assignment grading rubric Requirements Grades Codes could generate the results required by the problems 6 Necessary notes to indicate the general idea (usage, function, purpose, or mechanism) 3 Codes and notes are neat and well-organized 1 1.7 Course schedule Week Date Topic Week 1 Tue Mar 15 Course introduction + Introduction to RStudio Week 1 Thu Mar 17 Introduction to R Week 2 Tue Mar 22 Data manipulation with base functions Week 2 Thu Mar 24 Data manipulation with dplyr Part I Week 3 Tue Mar 29 Data manipulation with dplyr Part II Week 3 Thu Mar 31 Using IPUMS data in R with ipumsr (Guest speakers: Derek Burk, Dan Ehrlich, and Kara Fisher) Week 4 Tue Apr 5 Data visualization with base functions Week 4 Thu Apr 7 Data visualization with ggplot2 Part I Week 6 Tue Apr 12 Data visualization with ggplot2 Part II Week 6 Thu Apr 14 Data visualization with ggplot2 Part III Week 7 Tue Apr 19 Simple statistics in R Part I Week 7 Thu Apr 21 Simple statistics in R Part II Week 8 Tue Apr 26 Exploratory Data Analysis Part I Week 8 Thu Apr 28 Exploratory Data Analysis Part II 1.8 Homework and projects collaboration and submission policy Students can discuss their works with other students, but must code and write up notes by themselves.
